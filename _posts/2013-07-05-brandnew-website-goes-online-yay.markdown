Hy Guys and Visitors,

Only one month after we formed I finally set up a website and google group and github and twitter account and all the other things you do when founding a user group. We are still 3 and look forward to get some people in! Those pub rel things should help.

I already booked the domain river-spree.com, it was free and I am officially gonna sponsor the fee. The website is set up with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the code is on github. Always wanted to try that since [Parker Moore](https://github.com/parkr), who is the maintainer, gave a presentation at RUG:B. I got the permission of [Nico Trinkhaus](http://sumfinity.com/) to use his recent 500px.com top ranked [master shot](http://500px.com/photo/39448436) of Berlin in a storm on our website. I kinda built the site around the image. :-)

So, I hope you enjoy the site and please don't hesitate to catch up with us.

Cheers, Oliver

PS: For any non-Berliner who still did not get the naming joke: The Spree is as well the river flowing through Berlin!

Thanks to Captain Obvious, flies away.
