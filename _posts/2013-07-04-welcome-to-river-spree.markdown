We are the Berlin based Spree Commerce User group. Spree Commerce is a Open Source Ruby on Rails Engine and we help each other and cooperate on improvements and new gems.

{% highlight ruby %}
def welcome name
  puts "Hi, #{name}, come join us!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Currently we are pack of three and meet up right after the monthly RUG:B meetings. We are discussing and working on common issues with Spree to the benefit of all.

Catch up with us and be part of the team.

Cheers, Oliver
