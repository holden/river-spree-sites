    <h1>The Berlin Based Community</h1>
    <p>
      We are few but engaged developers seeking to work together on common problems. We benefit from each other's experiences and discuss issues that are better off in our community than in the global spree one. From time to time blogposts will be published if we hit an interesting topic.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you are interested in participating, just use one of the contacts below or meet us at the monthly <a href="http://berlin.onruby.de">RUG:B</a>, the Berlin Ruby User Group, meetings. There is a good chance we have a little drinkup in advance. We do not have a meetup schedule currently, but meet up occasionally. So, just contact us!
